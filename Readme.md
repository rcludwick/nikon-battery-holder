Nikon Battery Holder
====================

Printed in PETG at .20mm slicing on a prusa mk3s+.

The battery is shaped for the larger EN EL-3e battery.  But will still fit the more common and smaller EN-EL15.

It should fit a 70mm diameter by 3mm thickness O-ring if you would like to seal for water tightness.

It's a pretty tight fit, so I put a bit of krytox lubricant on the threads and screwed them on and off a few times.  

I updated the lid to allow the base to screw in easier.  At some angles the base was hard to screw into the lid.
